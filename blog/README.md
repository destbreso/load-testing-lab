## 📖 How to Use This Blog

This blog series is designed to be read **sequentially**, building knowledge from basic concepts to advanced techniques. Each article includes:

✅ **Reproducible examples** - All code works exactly as shown  
✅ **Real commands** - Uses actual toy-api endpoints and k6/Artillery scenarios  
✅ **Grafana insights** - References to actual dashboards (UIDs included)  
✅ **Hands-on exercises** - Experiments you can run immediately  

> 💡 **CLI vs Docker Compose**: Articles may show `docker-compose run --rm k6 run ...` commands. You can use the simpler CLI equivalent: `ltlab k6 -s scenario.js`. Both work identically. Run `npm link` first to enable the CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [x] Docker & Docker Compose installed
- [x] 4GB+ RAM available for containers
- [x] Basic understanding of HTTP/REST APIs
- [x] Terminal/command line comfort
- [ ] Node.js (optional, only if modifying toy-api)

## 📦 What You'll Work With

### **Toy API Endpoints** (Your Testing Playground)
```
GET  /health   → Health check
GET  /fast     → Quick responses (~5ms)
GET  /slow     → Simulated slow queries (~500ms)
GET  /cpu      → CPU-intensive operations
GET  /io       → I/O-bound operations
GET  /error    → Random failures (chaos testing)
POST /jobs     → Create async job
GET  /jobs/:id → Check job status
GET  /users    → User CRUD operations
```

### **k6 Scenarios** (Pre-configured Tests)
```
toy-fast.js         → Basic load test (50 VUs, 30s)
toy-stress.js       → Stress test (high concurrency)
toy-mixed.js        → Multiple endpoints
toy-workers.js      → Async job processing
inspection-flow.js  → Multi-step user flow
chaos-basic.js      → Mixed chaos (errors, latency, CPU)
chaos-spike.js      → Traffic spike with failures
chaos-resilience.js → Retry logic and recovery
```

### **Grafana Dashboards** (Real-time Visualization)

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Install CLI globally
npm link

# 2. Start the lab
ltlab start

# 3. Run your first test
ltlab k6 -s toy-fast.js

# 4. View results
open http://localhost:3000  # Grafana (admin/admin123)

# 5. Explore toy-api
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:5000/fast
```

### Using Your Own Test Files (External Projects)

The CLI automatically detects local files - no need to copy them into the lab:

```bash
# From your project directory
cd ~/projects/my-api

# Run your local k6 test (auto-detects local file)
ltlab k6 -s ./tests/load/stress-test.js

# For scenarios with imports/helpers, use project mode
ltlab k6 -p ./tests/load -s main.js

# Link your custom dashboards
ltlab dashboard link ./tests/load/dashboards
ltlab restart -s grafana
```

## 💡 Tips for Maximum Learning

### **Do This:**
✅ Run every example as you read  
✅ Experiment with parameters (change VUs, duration, endpoints)  
✅ Compare metrics in different dashboards  
✅ Try breaking things (test /error endpoint, high concurrency)  
✅ Take notes on patterns you observe  

### **Avoid This:**
❌ Skipping hands-on exercises  
❌ Reading without running the lab  
❌ Jumping to advanced articles without basics  
❌ Testing production systems without understanding impact  

---

## 🆘 Getting Help

### **If something doesn't work:**
1. Check `/blog/BLOG_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` for verified configurations
2. Verify services are running: `docker-compose ps`
3. Check logs: `docker-compose logs <service-name>`
4. Ensure you're using exact commands from articles (paths matter!)
5. Reset everything: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

### **Common Issues:**
- **No data in Grafana?** → Wait 10-15 seconds after test starts
- **Connection refused?** → Check `TARGET_API_URL=http://toy-api:5000` (not localhost)
- **High error rates?** → Intentional if testing `/error` endpoint!
- **Dashboard not found?** → Use exact UIDs from articles
