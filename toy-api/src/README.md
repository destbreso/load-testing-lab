# Toy API

A lightweight API designed to provide **realistic endpoints for load testing**.

## Available Endpoints

| Endpoint  | Behavior             |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `/fast`   | Instant response     |
| `/slow`   | Variable latency     |
| `/error`  | Random failures      |
| `/cpu`    | CPU-heavy workload   |
| `/io`     | Simulated I/O        |
| `/users`  | JSON dataset         |
| `/jobs`   | Async job simulation |
| `/health` | Health check         |

## Purpose

Used as a **sandbox backend** for Load Testing Lab demos and automated tests.
